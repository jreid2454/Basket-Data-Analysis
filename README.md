Welcome and thank you for taking the time to try out this program.

This program takes in a CSV file, with headers as follows:
        Name (string) | Days (int) | Characteristic 1 (string)| Characteristic 2 (string)

With this information, it will generate a report.

All of the file reading takes place in the browser, so there is no need to set up a server.

All you have to do, is leave all files in the same folder, and open index.html

From there, you will be able to upload your CSV file and generate a report.
